<h1>About Me</h1>

<p> I was 14 when I got hold of my first copy of Photoshop 7. Since then, I have had an unquenchable desire to learn! I am inquisitive, imaginative, and a quick-learner with a background in graphic design and digital strategy for the nonprofit sector. My experience working with lean social change organizations has taught me to be strategic but nimble, which I believe translates well into startup culture. The most fulfilling projects are team-driven in collaborative environments where I have the support and creative freedom to make a difference. I've learned that design is much more than aesthetics. It is an expression of an organizationâ€™s core values, their standards, their ethos. Reach out to me and let's see what we can create!</p>
